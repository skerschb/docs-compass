Overview
--------

.. admonition:: |compass| is available in the following editions

   - Compass

   - Compass Community Edition

   - Compass Readonly Edition (*New in version 1.12.0*)

   - Compass Isolated Edition (*New in version 1.14.0*)

   Each |compass| HELLO!!! edition is available in both a
   *General Availability* and a *Beta* version. To download any
   available version, go to the `MongoDB Download
   Center <https://www.mongodb.com/downloads?jmp=docs#compass>`_.

|compass| allows users to easily analyze and understand the contents of
their data collections within MongoDB and perform queries, without
requiring knowledge of MongoDB
:manual:`query syntax </tutorial/query-documents>`.

|compass| provides users with a graphical view of their MongoDB
schema by randomly sampling a subset of documents from the
collection. Sampling documents minimizes
performance impact on the database and can produce results quickly.
See the :ref:`FAQ<compass-faq-sampling>`
for further information on sampling.
